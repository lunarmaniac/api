  {"tip": "Avoid frequent object creation in loops, especially for temporary objects. Reuse objects or use object pools when possible.", "category": "Performance & Optimization"},
  {"tip": "Use batch processing instead of individual operations where possible. For example, insert multiple records in a single transaction rather than one at a time.", "category": "Performance & Optimization"},
  {"tip": "Optimize network calls by reducing requests, compressing data, or using caching layers. Network latency often dominates runtime in distributed applications.", "category": "Performance & Optimization"},
  {"tip": "Consider algorithmic trade-offs between time and space. Using more memory for caching or precomputation can reduce runtime.", "category": "Performance & Optimization"},
